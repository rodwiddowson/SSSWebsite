It looks likely that Microsoft will be introducing a logo program for filesystem and registry filters.
One can argue about the value of these programs especially for specific applications.  Whilst it is
easy to see the importance of logoing a full commodity offering like an AV filter it seems harder to apply
to specialist filters.

One way or another, if this program is announced it will be important to make your filters conformant.
Steading System Software have been working with these tests for many years and are well placed to help
you with this.

This post marks three changes:

Firstly, the website is now hosted by <a href="http://www.zen.co.uk">Zen</a>.  We started by using Zen just for ADSL and as we became more and more convinced by their customer service and less convinced by the support from others we moved first our land lines, then our backup, then our mobile phones and finally out website.

Next, he website is built (still using Jekyll) on a Windows 10 box, running the beta Linux subsystem that was introduced with Anniversary Edition

Finally, the source for the website is saved at <a href="https://github.com/rodwiddowson/SSSWebsite">Github</a>
